# Reynaldo Jarro

Hey, I'm a Computer Science/Business Administration 2024 graduate from the University of Southern California. I am very passionate about both Software Engineering and Cybersecurity. I am working towards some certifications such as Sec+, AWS Security, and TCM Security's PNPT.

I have used a variety of programming languages, frameworks, software, and tools throughout the years to complete projects. Currently, I am working on two projects: Kalao, a LLM Chatbot that uses RAG
based on results from nmap scans and API calls from NIST and exploitdb to identify exploitable ports or systems in the network, and also working on a website to track card collection progress
for a specific TCG called Chaotic that has a very niche community, at the moment I am working on wrapping up the public API for card image and information.
